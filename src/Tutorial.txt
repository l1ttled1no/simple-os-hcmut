In case you're working in ubuntu and github desktop suck
This tutorial will guide you how to deal with input
First clone the repository from github

git clone https://github.com/l1ttled1no/simple-os-hcmut.git

Change into the cloned repository

cd simple-os-hcmut

Check the status of your repository

git status

Okay, done with the setup, at the beginning, we should check if there is any update from the remote repository

git pull origin main

If you make some changes and then you want to push 

git status
git add src/queue.c src/sched.c // Replace with the modified file, this is just an example

Commit your changes:

git commit -m "Updated queue.c and sched.c, added obj/ and os"

Push:

git push origin main

Good luck !!!
